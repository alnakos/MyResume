        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>My work experience counts for many years where through them I gained experience and development both as a person and as a professional.
            I strengthened parts of my personality such as critical perception, empathy, and leadership skills.
            They became stronger abilities like organization, camaraderie, hard work and all that plus many more traits that still made me what I am to this day.
            I hope in the future to gain even more experiences and become better.
